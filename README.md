For running the project just clone the repo, you must have npm,node and bower install on your system and after that:
1. run npm install
2. run bower install (while doing the bower install it will ask for the version of angualar, select the 6th option as the answer)
3. gulp serve

After doing guip serve u can open the application at localhost:9000
